## Description

<ul>
<li>
The motivation behind this project was to implement a weather forecast site, that uses a third-party weather API.
</li>
<li>
Through the OpenWeather API, we're able to select different data points to display. 
</li>
<li>
This project is a very easy tool that people can use in their every day lives.
</li>
</ul>

## Installation

<ol>
<li>
In order to begin this project, we must first have a suitable code viewer, such as VSCode. From there, we will need a base html file, and link our javascript, jquery, bootstrap, and css libraries to it.
</li>
<li>
Next we open a browser that supports dev tools like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
</li>
<li>
After we have our broswer and codeviewer open, we can begin to run our code and functions to ensure that we are getting the desired results.
</li>
<li>
After we finish our code, we eliminate any reduncies in the code to make it more viewable by other developers - and run our last few spot checks in various browsers to ensure the fully-deployed page is behaving correctly.
</li>
</ol>
